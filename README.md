# braille-printer

braille-printer is our solution to the CSS & Bloomberg Accessibility Hackathon. It is a python program with a simple GUI which takes a string and produces a braille sign for 3D printing.

The aim of the solution is to simplify the process of producing braille signs for use in local businesses, schools etc, as otherwise they are usually custom ordered online.

Developed in Python using Tkinter and Blender by Louis Heath, Muntazim Ali, [Miklos Borsi](https://github.com/borsimiklos) and Kenny Lomas.
